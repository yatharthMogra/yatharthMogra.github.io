			"I’m a computer science graduate student with a background in building real systems. I’ve worked as a software developer, competed in hackathons, and spend an unhealthy amount of time turning vague ideas into working products. I care about clean abstractions, strong fundamentals, and shipping things that actually get used. Lately, I’m focused on machine learning systems, reasoning models, and building tools that reduce human busywork.",
			"Right now, I work as a research assistant at NYU Langone Health, where I am building deep learning pipelines to predict time to total knee replacement. The work sits at the intersection of healthcare and ML, with a focus on translating data into clinically meaningful signals.",
			"I graduated from IIT Mandi and worked as a software development engineer at Walmart, building production systems at scale. Alongside that, I’ve consistently explored ideas through hackathons and side projects, which shaped how I think about speed, constraints, and practical problem-solving."
